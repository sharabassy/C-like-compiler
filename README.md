# C-like-compiler

this project was done for a compilers course at college.
followed the tutorial "A COMPACT GUIDE TO LEX & YACC" by Tom Niemann.


design and implement a simple programming language using the Lex and Yacc compiler generating package.

The Project comprises the following:

1.important constructs to be considered are

	• Variables and Constants declaration.
	
	• Mathematical and logical expressions.
	
	• Assignment statement.
	
	• If-then-else statement, while loops, repeat-until loops, for loops, switch statement.
	
	• Block structure (nested scopes where variables may be declared at the beginning of blocks).
	
	
2. Design a suitable and extensible format for the symbol table.

3. Implement the lexical analyzer using Lex.

4. Design suitable action rules to produce the output quadruples and implement your parser using YACC.

5. Implement a proper syntax error handler.

6. Build a simple semantic analyzer to check for the following:

	• Variable declaration conflicts. i.e. multiple declaration off the same variable.
	
	• Improper usage of variables with regard to their type.
	
	• [optional] The addition of type conversion quadruples to coupe with operators semantic requirements, i.e. converting integer to real, etc.
	
	• Variables used before being initialized and unused variables.
	
7. Implement a simple GUI.
